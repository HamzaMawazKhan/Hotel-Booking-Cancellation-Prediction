# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-Prediction
This notebook contains an exploratory data analysis of a hotel booking dataset, followed by feature engineering and then the building and evaluation of a suite of machine learning classifiers to predict which bookings will result in cancellations. Achieving a 100% accuracy in predicting booking cancellations using ensemble based machine learning classifiers.

The ML Models built and evaluated in this project are the following: Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Ada Boost Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, XgBoost, Cat Boost, LGBM, Voting Classifier, Logistic Regression, KNN, ANN
